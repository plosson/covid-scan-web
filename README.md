# Covid Scan Web 

Pure client side Covid Scan version. 

Use this instead of the Covid Scan application to have an open source Digital Green Pass 
reading application. 

This application only shows what is embedded in the QR code. 

It does not perform any validation rule, so you can let everyone in (as you should)
